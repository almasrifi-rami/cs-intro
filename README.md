# (MIT 6.0001) Introduction To Computer Science And Programming In Python

The repository includes assignments completed during my journey through the introduction to computer science and programming in Python course. I documented all the projected mentioned and left a few notes (for others as well as to myself).

## Problem set 0

Very easy and nothing worth mentioning about it :(

## Problem set 1

An enjoyable exercise of making a program to calculate time to save or percentage to save for a house (or anything really). The most intensive exercise was implementing the bisection search algorithm. Another side note, is the challenge of modifying the code from each part into the next.

## Problem set 2

Implementing the game Hangman is a good introduction into python's capabilities with functions and modularization. It was a lot of fun, especially when playing the game after completing it (I guess playing your own game is a different beast).

## Problem set 3

Another interesting game in python (the word game). Although without the hints implementation later on, it is virtually impossible to win.

## Problem set 4

First introduction to classes and recursive programming. Recursive programming is weird to think about at first but after some time it becomes the most natural way to solve an exercise (sometimes it doesn't work though when using on something complicated).

## Problem set 5

Continuing with classes to make an RSS feed to filter news stories from a website. Very interestingly the program took a few tweaks in the code to run, but it is interesting to know that you can make almost anything in Python.

## Final words

Overall the course covers the basics of programming with Python and the core elements of programming. The problem sets are the most notable about it with a lot of fun and practice to show for in this course. I would recommend taking this course for anyone interested in starting to learn programming and anyone looking for a quick review of fundamentals.
